# Freeform_Dynabots

Dynabots can only be used in Geomagic Freeform Plus, kind of like an equivalent to office macros.

They are sequential lists of "Tasks", tool operations and applicationactions, that can be invoked as automation macros or interactive wizards.
They are a powerful tool but nowhere close to office macros.

This is a repository of general purpose dynabots.
